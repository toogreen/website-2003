<p>&nbsp;</p><!font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><h2>Welcome!</h2></strong><p> Canadian photographer and reporter, currently based in Shanghai, China.<p> I have chosen a quite unlikely path to do my work, as most go through Journalism School and do internships in newspapers, I have chosen to leave everything behind in Montreal, Canada, and leave for the far ends of the world.<p> Since 1996, I have been working in newspapers and some freelance work some wires, writing and taking photos. Even though I have explored some editorial positions, I remain grabbed by the passion of reporting and the joys of photography.<p>Ever since coming out from University I have been freelancing for <a href="http://www.voir.ca" target="_blank">Voir</a> and for <a href="http://www.ottawaxpress.ca" target="_blank">The Ottawa Xpress</a>. In 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks in New York, I decided to make off for India. My first goal was not war, but it followed me as one day after landing in New Delhi the attacks on the Indian Parliament (December 13, 2001) changed the whole situation in the subcontinent.<p> Soon after, back in New Delhi from Pakistan and the Kashmir region, I left the <a href="http://www.globalmarch.org">Non-Governmental Organisation</a> I was working for to start making my own ways through Kashmir, Pakistan, India, Nepal and China.<p><p><b><a href="mailto:Philippe@photojournaliste.ca">Philippe Roy</a></b><!/font></p>
