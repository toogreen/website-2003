<br> This version of Apache includes many optimizations, Extended
Application Programming Interface (EAPI), Shared memory module, hooks for
SSL modules, and several patches/cosmetic improvements.

It is also fully modular, and many modules are available in pre-compiled 
format, like PHP4, the Hotwired XSSI module and Apache-ASP. Also included are
special patches to enable FrontPage 2000 support (see mod_frontpage
package).
