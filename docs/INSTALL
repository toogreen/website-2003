5 easy steps for a successful Adaptive Website Framework (AWF) installation:

1) Untar the archive (should be awf-1.XX.tar.gz) in the directory of 
your choice. The http server (normally Apache) need to have read AND 
write access (if you don't know how to do this, try "man chmod", "man chgrp" 
and "man chown" on UNIX systems). The files should belong to your Web server 
(httpd) and/or PHP safe_mode should be disabled, in order to make the upload
features work.

2) PHP 4.1.0 (or better) and an installed MySQL server are required. 
For security and performance reasons, I recommend PHP 4.2.1 or any later version.
You can enable register_globals, but should set magic_quotes_gpc = Off in your
php.ini (default location is /usr/local/lib/php.ini). If unsure, ask your
hosting service provider or have a look at http://php.net/docs.php.

3) If not yet done, create a database user with read/write permissions and 
a database (CREATE DATABASE [name]) in MySQL. If you need help, have a look
at http://www.mysql.com/ or ask your hosting service provider.

4) If not yet done, start your Web server and verify, that you can connect ;)
On Linux, this can be normally done with "/etc/init.d/httpd start" (must be root!)

5) Finally, you can continue using the installation script admin/setup.php.

That's all.

AWF should then be available at http://www.domain.com/index.php. The initial default 
users are "a" and "b" (passwords are "a" and "b" too). "a" is editor and "b" normal 
user. Changes can be made using the User Management script (/admin/users.php).

Please don't forget to protect the directories admin, cache, inc and 
users with .htaccess files!

You can distribute AWF as free software, according to the GNU General Public License (Version 2).
For more information, use http://www.fsf.org/.

If you want to contact the development team, you'll find all names in docs/AUTHORS. 
Some help in development of new versions and designs/layouts is always welcome!

take care and have fun,
