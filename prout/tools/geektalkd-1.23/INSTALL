INSTALLATION

There is a cute install script in this folder.  To install geektalkd, just type
./install
in this folder.

It configures geektalkd to use Net::Ident if you have it, and then copies the
scripts to the install directory, and places a symlink in /usr/local/sbin.

Options to ./install:
    --prefix=/path/to/install
        Sets the path where geektald will be installed.
        Directories will be created as necessary.  The default is
        /usr/local/geektalkd.

    --no-symlink
        Do not install a symlink for the binary in /usr/local/sbin

    --symlink-path=/path/to/symlink
        Install the geektalkd symlink in /path/to/symlink.  The
        default is /usr/local/sbin.

PROBLEMS

Uhm, I used options for the BSD/GNU `install` so it might not work on SysV
`install` programs that aren't backwards compatible.  But I checked, and the
Solaris and Irix version both are, so ehhh!
